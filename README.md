__legendary-pancake__ is a static site generator based on Webpack, React and React Router.

- __JavaScript defined pages.__ legendary-pancake makes no assumption about your site structure. All your pages are defined in a single `pages.js` file, so you can leverage Webpack and JavaScript to generate multiple pages from your data!

- __Asynchronous page loading.__ Pages are resolved asynchronously, so you can leverage Webpack’s code-splitting features so split your site into multiple chunks.

  Since it makes no assumption about how your pages are loaded, you can split by page, or group pages together in the same chunk. You can load new pages on demand, or you can preload the next page in the background.

- __Hot reloading.__ Thanks to React and declarative DOM, hot-reloading is supported!
