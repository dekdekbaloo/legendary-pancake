<p><strong>legendary-pancake</strong> is an <strong><em>advanced</em></strong> static site generator based on webpack, React and React Router. It has been extracted from Taskworld’s marketing site which requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Localization.</strong> The entire site may be translated into multiple languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A/B testing.</strong> We sometimes must generate more than one version of the same page to be able to perform A/B testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prerendering.</strong> As a marketing site, the web page must appear as quickly as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code splitting.</strong> With many pages, it’s too slow to download the entire site’s content. We must be able to group related pages together as well to make navigation between different pages instantaneous.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is designed for advanced users and gives you total control of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Your site structure.</strong>
Unlike <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby">Gatsby</a>, it doesn’t generate routes based on filesystem layout.
<em>You</em> define every route programmatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How you write CSS.</strong>
PostCSS? PreCSS? cssnext? Sass? LESS? Stylus? CSS Modules? Autoprefixer? Inline Styles?
legendary-pancake has no preference on this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The prerendering process.</strong>
You decide how your React element gets turned into an HTML file.</p>
<p>You can use libraries like <a href="https://github.com/gaearon/react-document-title">react-document-title</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet">react-helmet</a> to help with <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> elements, or roll your own solution.
Inline your CSS or JS in your HTML file, or put it in another chunk. It’s all up to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Route loading.</strong> legendary-pancake has no preference on how to load your page contents. For small sites, you can package the entire site content in a single bundle.</p>
<p>Or you can use webpack’s <a href="https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html">code splitting</a> or <a href="https://github.com/webpack/bundle-loader">bundle-loader</a> to split your contents into multiple chunks which are loaded asynchronously, either eagerly or on-demand.
Create a chunk for every page, or group related pages together based on analytics data, like we do at Taskworld.
You’re in total control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your deployment process.</strong>
The pages will be built in <code>build/pages</code> and other webpack assets in <code>build/browser</code>.
The rest is up to you.
By separating the data from the assets, this allows for some advanced use-cases, such as A/B testing a static site.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But <code>legendary-pancake</code> will take care of these for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Development and building workflow.</strong>
It comes with a CLI tool to run the development server and generate the static site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing URLs and route transitions.</strong>
legendary-pancake preconfigures React Router to support asynchronous routing and prerendering at the same time, and abstracts it away behind an API that is more suited for static routes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
