As I’ve previously said before, legendary-pancake is an ___advanced___ tool,
so it doesn’t try to abstract away from the intricacies of webpack.

# Setting up the project

Create an empty directory for your website:

```sh
mkdir my-site
cd my-site
```

Initialize a package:

```sh
yarn init -y
```

Install legendary-pancake:

```sh
yarn add --dev legendary-pancake
```

More info later lol
